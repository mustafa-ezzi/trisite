# 🔒 Privacy Policy  
**Effective Date: May 4, 2021**

At Trisite Solutions, we respect your privacy — simple as that. Whether you're just browsing or reaching out for services, we want you to feel confident that your data is safe with us.

This page explains what we collect, why we collect it, and what we do (and don’t do) with it.

## 📥 What Information We Collect

We may collect a few types of information to provide a better experience:

- **Basic Contact Details**: Like your name, email address, and phone number when you fill out a form or reach out to us.
- **Website Usage Info**: Things like your IP address, browser type, and the pages you visit — collected automatically through cookies and analytics tools.

We don’t collect sensitive personal data (like passwords, banking info, etc.) unless you provide it for a specific reason.

## 🎯 Why We Collect It

We only use your information for legit reasons like:

- Responding to your queries or messages  
- Sending updates if you’ve subscribed (no spam, pinky promise)  
- Improving how our website works and feels  
- Keeping everything secure and legally compliant  

## 🧯 How We Protect Your Data

Security isn’t optional for us. We use:

- SSL encryption to keep your connection private  
- Regular security checks and updates  
- Access restrictions so only authorized people can view your data  

Basically: we don’t mess around with security.

## 🙅‍♂ What We Don’t Do

- We **don’t sell** your data. Ever.  
- We **don’t spam** you with irrelevant content.  
- We **don’t share** your info unless it’s necessary (like with trusted services helping us run the site, or if law requires it).

## 🍪 Cookies

Yeah, we use cookies — but the digital kind 🍪

Cookies help us:

- Understand how you use the site  
- Remember preferences (like dark/light mode)  
- Improve performance  

If you want, you can block cookies from your browser settings. The site will still work — just maybe not as smooth.

## 🧾 Your Rights

You’re in control of your data. You can:

- Ask us what data we have on you  
- Request changes or deletion  
- Opt out of any future communications  

Just send us an email at **website@trisitesolutions.com** and we’ll sort it out, no stress.

## 🔁 Changes to This Policy

We may update this page if laws change or if we launch new features. Any major changes? We’ll highlight them right here.

We recommend checking this page once in a while to stay updated.
